This repo maintains the visualization of Covid-19 spread in US.
The data source is Kaggle from: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

In my version1 file: The data is till 03/18/2020, this data contained the US state/province information
hence I was able to break it down to state level for visualization, but while I was cleaning up my code 
and pulled the latest data on 03/27/2020, the state information for US was not present and was replaced 
with NA. However I am hoping it will be added soon by the producer. So I am keeping the code for 
state level as it is in my version2.file along with code cleanup.

I will keep on updating this repo as I keep working.
